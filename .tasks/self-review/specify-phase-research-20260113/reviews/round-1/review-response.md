Issues
- MAJOR: Missing coverage of prompt engineering/requirements expression despite being in scope; the AI-era section does not address prompt design or requirement phrasing. `00-task-spec.md:22` `specify-research-report.md:85`
- MAJOR: Traditional requirements methodology is in scope but not covered; Part 1 only includes user stories, acceptance criteria, and NFRs without a methodology overview. `00-task-spec.md:17` `specify-research-report.md:19`
- MINOR: Source attribution is inconsistent in the Clarify section; the quote cites Zencoder but the section "来源" lists a different source, making evidence unclear. `specify-research-report.md:139` `specify-research-report.md:142`
- MINOR: Several best-practice claims lack direct sourcing (e.g., "3-7 acceptance criteria" guidance). `specify-research-report.md:65`
- MINOR: Typo/wording reduces clarity ("治疗 context" should read as "treat context" or equivalent). `specify-research-report.md:124`
