- Key elements of a requirements prompt template
- Distinction between Prompt Engineering and Context Engineering
- Sources: OpenAI and Anthropic prompt guides

### 2. Missing Requirements Methodology Overview

- Core methodologies table (瀑布式, 敏捷迭代, 用户中心设计, 领域驱动设计)
- Key activities (Elicitation, Analysis, Specification, Validation)
- Sources: IEEE 830, BABOK Guide
